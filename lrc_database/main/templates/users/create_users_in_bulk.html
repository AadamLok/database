    <h2>Create users in bulk</h2>
    <p>
        Write user data into the text area below. For each user you wish to add, add a single line with the following values in order and separated by commas.
        <ul>
            <li>a username, like "jshmoe"</li>
            <li>an email address, like "jshmoe@umass.edu"</li>
            <li>a first name, like "Joe"</li>
            <li>a last name, like "Shmoe"</li>
            <li>a primary group, which must be one of "Office staff", "Supervisors" or "Staff"(mind the capitalization!)</li>
        </ul>
        so the full line would be something like <code>jshmoe,jshmoe@umass.edu,Joe,Shmoe,Staff</code>.
    </p>
    <p>You can export large numbers of lines like this easily from programs like Excel by looking for an "export to CSV" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" target="_blank">comma-separated values</a>) or similar option.</p>
